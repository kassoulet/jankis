Jankis Duplicate Finder
=======================

What it is about?

  Jankis is a gtk graphical program to find and delete duplicate files.


Another one?

  Hum, yes.


So what makes Jankis better than the competition?

  Jankis is fast. And I designed it to be powerful and easy to use.
  It checks only the beginning of the files, and this is perfect to look for
  corrupted or incomplete files.


OK, what's next?

  Do a "chmod +x jankis.py", and run "./jankis.py". No installer yet.
  Go to the preferences, and choose the minimal file size you want to report.
  Now you can scan your home folder, the whole filesystem, or any folder you
  want, just choose the right button.

It's slow!

  You have too much files...


What are all those columns for?

  You see for each file its filename, its size, and its MD5 hash.
  The MD5 hash tells you if the files are identical.

  You can use the "original" button to mark the original files.
  The "delete" button will... Hum, remove the file.
  And finally the "link" button will create an hard link to the original file,
  removing the duplicate file's used space.


PLEASE NOTE THAT JANKIS'S JOB IS TO DELETE FILES.
BE CAREFUL!
